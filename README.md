## Abstract

This study investigates the predictive efficiency of various forecasting models for renewable energy asset prices, using oil price and investor sentiment. For renewable energy assets, renewable energy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are considered. Two sentiment indices are constructed using the first principal component: a fund-level investor sentiment index based on traditional indices (the Relative Strength Index and the Psychological Line Index), and a Google Trend Index derived from search trend data with keywords related to the respective renewable energy ETFs.

We propose a prediction model integrating both sentiment indices within a deep learning framework. The study shows that models incorporating the modified fund-level investor sentiment and Google Trends indices outperform those using unmodified indices. The results highlight the effectiveness of multi-source sentiment integration, with a significant contribution from the Google Trend Index. Among the models tested, the CNN-LSTM model outperforms both CNN and BiLSTM models, validated by Modified Diebold-Mariano tests.

The findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources and advanced modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy in the renewable energy sector.

## Contribution

This study offers important insights into the prediction of renewable energy asset prices, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating multiple sentiment indices (including Google Trends) within deep learning models like CNN-LSTM. These results are useful for various stakeholders in the renewable energy sector, including investors, analysts, and policymakers.

## Conclusion

The integration of both traditional sentiment measures and Google Trends data into a deep learning framework significantly improves the prediction of renewable energy asset prices. This approach offers a promising direction for future research and real-world applications in the renewable energy market.
